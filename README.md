#JS Loops Relay Race (WDI Outcomes Activity)

There are six simple JS problems in **exercise.js** -- they're split out by comments. exercise.js is the *only* file you should modify, and you should use the prescribed loops to solve each problem (instructors and guest engineers will be checking, and watching for your problem-solving strategies!).

Solve a problem, then pass the laptop to your teammate! Everyone can help, but one person at a time should drive, and each person on the team should answer one problem :) 

Note: the problems increase in difficulty!
